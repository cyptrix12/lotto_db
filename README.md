A simple script to help people with lot of lottery tickets.

Idea came from watching this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRVntvG9mAw

for non-polish speakers:
This youtuber bought 100 lottery tickets, to find out how much he will win.

After annoucing winning numbers he checked every ticket by hand.

who would want to do that!!!!!!

not me.



so in 2 days i made a script to help with this 10 minute job.
